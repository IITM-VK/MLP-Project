# Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the success of telemarketing campaigns conducted by a banking institution. The campaigns involve contacting potential customers via phone calls to promote a bank term deposit. The goal is to use machine learning techniques to analyze the data and predict whether a customer will subscribe to the term deposit ('yes') or not ('no').
